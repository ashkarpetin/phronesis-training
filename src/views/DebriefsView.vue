                When you enter invalid amount (for example, $15,000), the
                validation error is shown for all methods except Google Pay one.
                Clicking on Google Pay button shows a modal with some different
                valid amount ($1,500), and allows to pay for it.

                There is no way to update billing address for the saved payment
                card, the only way is to add a new card with same PAN.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-2">
                Google Pay button refreshes every time the deposit amount
                changed. Not great UX, not sure if it is feature or bug.

              <li class="mb-2">
                Deposit configuration form in Recomm for absolute calculator
                with increments is still confusing. First time we configured it
                incorrectly. To display amounts of $5, $10, $25, $50 and $100 we
                need to set base amount to $5 and increments to $5, $20, $45,
                $95 which is not obvious, and not great UX.

              <li class="mb-2">
                If you check "Set base amount to match customerâ€™s last deposit",
                and define custom amounts with maximum of $10000. Then make a
                payment with $10000, the next deposit form shows amounts $10000,
                $10005, $10020, $10045, $10045. But custom amounts are still
                limited to $10000. Not sure if this a bug or expected behavior.

              We used reactivation quotes to reactivate subscriptions. It took
              us around 1 hour to complete the training, didn't find any major
              issues. We were able to test webhooks using
              https://requestcatcher.com/ service which did not require any
              authentication.

                Subscription renewal time got modifed to +1 second. Not sure
                why. The message "Subscription renewal time modified" is
                confusing in timeline when time format is 12h, because it looks
                like renewal time didn't change.

                Datetime values in the timelines tables do not adhere to the
                profile's time format. On the screen it is clearly shown that
                timeline creation time is in 24h format according to profile
                settings, but in the table it is shown in 12h format.
